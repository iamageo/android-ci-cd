# Android CI/CD
This repository contains a sample of how to create pipelines with the most popular platforms.

`Continuous integration` is a practice of integrating source code into a shared repository frequently, then each commit is verified by an automated system to check for errors or get reports on code quality.

<!--
Examples of continuous integration processes for android projects include:

* Performing build.
* Linting - Analyzing source code to check for language syntax violation.
* Executing tests ie. unit tests and instrumentation tests.
* Generating reports. Eg tests reports, lint reports etc.

-->

`Continuous delivery` is a practice of getting changes(ie. new features, bug fixes, configuration changes) into production or into the users’/testers’ hands safely and quickly or frequently.

<!--
Examples of `continuous delivery` processes for android projects include:

* Creating a GitHub release.
* Deploying to Firebase App Distribution.
* Deploying to Google Play Store.
* Updating automated documentation.
